# Systems and platforms

## Walk-by

Fast remote reading without errors or downtime. Based on the Range ONE device and the Route ONE app, the system automates data capture and device diagnostics in the field.

**Key features:**

- Automatic reading of water, heat, heating cost allocators, gas, and electricity meters
- Instant data transfer to the platform without physical access to meters
- Built-in diagnostics and servicing of measuring modules in the field
- Integration with Route ONE for reports and alarm handling
- Reliable communication in hard-to-reach locations thanks to 868 MHz radio
- Walk-by workflow shortens service time and reduces operational costs

## Star/Fix

Continuous supervision and full control over media using a star topology. Meters communicate directly with the concentrator or via repeaters to maintain visibility of the network.

**Key features:**

- Star architecture for devices compliant with Wireless M-Bus or OMS
- Automated readings and balancing of utility consumption
- Rapid response to alarms and anomalies through remote notifications
- Range extension with ECLIPSE or EXIO repeaters
- Central configuration of parameters and reading schedules
- Secure data handling with encryption and controlled access

## MESH

An intelligent self-configuring metering network that keeps communication running even in demanding conditions. Installation is as simple as powering the concentrator and starting the network.

**Key features:**

- Self-healing mesh topology guaranteeing transmission continuity
- Single data concentrator with automatic delivery to the cloud
- Minimal maintenance costs thanks to zero manual intervention
- Automatic discovery of new devices and route optimisation
- Scales to thousands of meters without loss of service quality
- Advanced real-time reports, alarms, and resource management
