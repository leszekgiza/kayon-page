**SECTION 0 – HOMEPAGE**

**Version 1**

**Lead**

In a world where technology sets the pace of change, those who embrace it earlier gain the advantage. Our remote meter-reading systems for water and heat already comply with the EU regulations that will become mandatory in 2027.

**Expansion**

We design our solutions with every market participant in mind – distributors, installers, property managers, developers, housing cooperatives, homeowner associations and individual residents.

Each of them benefits in a tangible way: guaranteed reliability, easier installation, stable operation, constant access to data, lower risk of billing errors and lower costs.

With Kayon measurement devices and systems you can not only precisely measure water and heat consumption, but also permanently reduce operating costs and energy use. The result is a stable and harmonious environment for everyone involved.

**SECTION 1 – WHO WE ARE**

**Experience that builds trust**

Kayon is a Polish technology company with years of experience in designing and manufacturing modern devices and systems for remote water and heat metering. Our team consists of engineers and specialists with over two decades of metering expertise – people who co-created today’s industry standards. Thanks to them our solutions are technically refined, durable, proven and user-friendly – ready for the challenges of the future.

**Technology ready for tomorrow**

Our advantage comes not only from the quality of the hardware but also from the software. The **ALL in KAYON** system enables the management and reporting of data from thousands of meters simultaneously. It replaces time-consuming paper reports, sprawling spreadsheets and disparate tools with one simple workspace for all stakeholders. The interface is clear and intuitive, so administrators, managers and installers can easily control consumption, generate reports and communicate with residents. **ALL in KAYON** lets you work with any metering devices from any manufacturer, giving customers the freedom to choose and independence from closed ecosystems.

**Kayon is gaining recognition across Europe**

Our solutions are already operating successfully in Poland, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and Western Europe. Since 2025 they have been available in Germany and across Europe via GWF AG – a renowned Swiss provider of precision metering technology. Today Kayon is also present on the German market on its own, building a dedicated network of partners and distributors.

**SECTION 2 – OUR CLIENTS**

**Kayon delivers a precise answer to the needs of every stakeholder group**

- **Distributors** value the flexibility of adapting technology to local requirements and the straightforward integration of **ALL in KAYON** with their existing distribution platforms. They can offer a complete, scalable solution that is ready to deploy without costly customisation.
- **Installation companies** appreciate the intuitive installation process, full compatibility of components and the equipment’s resilience to installation mistakes. Deployment is fast, requires no specialised tools and configuration takes just a few logical steps.
- **Building administrators** gain full control of infrastructure in one place. **ALL in KAYON** consolidates data from many buildings into a single system – everything from meters to alerts and costs is available in real time and within easy reach.
- **Property managers** rely on uninterrupted readings and remote access to well-organised data. The system enables rapid consumption reporting, easy anomaly detection and instant access to the entire metering history – without the risk of data loss.
- **Housing cooperatives and homeowner associations** benefit from transparent billing and straightforward verification of individual consumption. Every resident can track their usage, which relieves administrative teams and reduces the number of enquiries.

We deliver all of this while maintaining high energy efficiency and minimising environmental impact. Not because it is fashionable, but because well-designed systems should operate efficiently and without failure – to the benefit of people and the planet.

**SECTION 3 – HOW WE OPERATE**

**We provide devices and services that minimise costs**

Kayon solutions are designed so that every stakeholder – from the distributor and installer to the property manager and resident – can achieve tangible savings, lower operating expenses, reduce manual work and gain greater control.

**What does this mean in practice?**

- **Pay only for actual consumption**  
  Accurate, stable readings remove the need for estimates and eliminate underbilling. Transparent, fair settlements build trust and long-term cooperation.

- **No downtime or failures**  
  Devices operate for up to 15 years on a single battery, allowing installers and administrators to focus on management rather than maintenance.

- **Installation time saved**  
  Plug & play hardware can be installed quickly even in demanding environments. Configuration takes just a few simple steps and can be done remotely, without on-site access – even by less experienced technicians.

- **Straightforward management of large data sets**  
  Mobile and web applications are intuitive, clear and accessible from anywhere. Readings, history, reports and alerts are organised so that daily work for managers and communities is as simple as possible.

- **Full compatibility and flexibility**  
  Our devices support the most popular protocols (MBus, wMBus, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, LTE, Bluetooth), so you can choose the hardware that best fits your needs without vendor lock-in.

**SECTION 3 – WHAT WE OFFER**

We combine modern products with a system-wide approach that streamlines day-to-day operations and keeps every user of the system satisfied.

**A. Products designed to benefit the end user**

Every device we deliver is engineered to:

- **operate for years** (up to 15 years on a single battery),
- **remain reliable** (even in humid, dusty or temperature-variable environments),
- **be easy to install and configure** (no specialised tools required),
- **withstand installation errors** (e.g. incorrect wiring does not damage the device).

**B. One system – ALL in KAYON – integrating products from any manufacturer**

Our solutions build a complete **ALL in KAYON** ecosystem: from communication modules and concentrators to applications that also manage sensors from other vendors and cloud data.  
That means:

- **real-time remote readings** without on-site visits,
- **automatic alerts and reports** that save time,
- **full control and remote firmware updates** (**OTA** – Over-the-Air),
- **less stress and less manual work** for installers, administrators and end users.
